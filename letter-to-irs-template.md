Statement for 1040-NR U.S. Nonresident Alien Income Tax Return

US Federal tax withheld of $Z mistakenly classified as a dividend.

I am claiming an exemption from withholding on a distribution from a U.S. corporation with respect to its stock because, in my particular circumstances, the transaction qualifies as a redemption of stock under section 302, I attach a statement that describes the transaction and I present the facts necessary to establish that the payment was a complete redemption, a substantially disproportionate redemption, or not essentially equivalent to a dividend.

On Nov 22 2023 Broadcom completed the acquisition of VMware. All vested VMW stock that I held in E*TRADE Morgan Stanley was converted to Broadcom stock and cash (52.1% stock, 47.9% cash). I had already paid withholding tax according to the tax treaty between < Your country > and USA on all of the vested stock prior at vesting time, however the broker classified the converted stock to cash (47.9%) as dividends, withholding an additional $Z for tax purposes. I held X VMW stock at the time of the merger, of which W stock units (47.9%) were converted to cash equating to $Y. This transaction was classified incorrectly as a dividend, hence 15% withholding was applied to $Y, equating to $Z. I ask for a refund of $Z to My Bank:
